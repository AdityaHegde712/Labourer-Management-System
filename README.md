# Labourer-Management-System
An offline GUI-based laborer management system with database integration for entry storage. 
It can add/remove regular workers, add one-time entries and monthly worker entries, view final wage expenses for regular and one-time workers, the grand total, and view attendance of the regular workers, and retrieve their details.
